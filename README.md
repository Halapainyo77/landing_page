Odin Landing Page Project:
This project will hopefully build the skills I have gained so far from my time doing the Odin Project, which will range from html to css. A lot will revolve around flex-box. I probably will be inefficient in my use of properties and selectors, though this will be due to trying to replicate the given images as much as possible.
